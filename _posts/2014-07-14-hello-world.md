title: Hello world!

I'm Kevin, a rising sophomore Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I figured I'd start a blog. Here goes nothing.

## Moderately interesting bio

I've been fascinated by computers for as long as I can remember. I built my first computer in 2006, at age 11. That baby had a dual-core AMD Athlon processor, 1 GB of memory, 80 GB of storage, and ran Windows XP. Around the same time, I discovered HTML, and I made a state-of-the-art website with tables, "Under Construction" gifs, and probably a `<marquee>` element or two. If I recall correctly, it was modestly titled, "Kevin's Awesome Website."

My first exposure to programming came in the form of a programming course I took in Taiwan the summer of 2007. I don't remember anything about it though, except that the software we used was in Chinese and that it didn't support Windows Vista.

But let's fast forward to my first *real* exposure to programming, which was at an [iD Tech Camp](http://www.idtech.com/) at Fordham University in 2009, the summer before my freshman year of high school. There I took a one-week "Programming in C++" course. I came out of the course with my own text adventure called *Game*, in which you play as a secret agent tasked with stealing KFC's secret recipe. More importantly, I also came out of the course with a passion for programming.

I then entered [Stuyvesant High School](http://www.stuy.edu/), the most stressful yet rewarding four years of my life thus far, and a topic about which I will most certainly write more in the future. There, I joined the school's [FIRST Robotics team](http://stuypulse.com/) as a freshman&mdash;specifically, its [programming division](https://github.com/prog694), where I learned how to work with, and later coordinate, a team of software engineers to write robot code in Java. From sophomore year onwards, I took [every CS course](http://www.stuycs.org/) offered by Stuy, and graduated with highest honors in Computer Science.

I graduated from Stuy in 2013, and have just finished my freshman year at [UIUC](http://cs.illinois.edu/), where I am a member of [ACM@UIUC](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/), the UIUC student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery. I am spending this summer as an software engineer intern at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), an experience about which I will go into more detail in a future post.

## Finally: Why did I choose to start a blog?

I've been meaning to start a blog in order to share my experiences as a developer and as a human being. As it turns out, one of the three pillars of development at KA is to "[Be open. Share your work.](https://sites.google.com/a/khanacademy.org/forge/for-developers)"

> Focus on sharing our work both internally and externally with the entire community. **Blog about your work.** Tell the whole team when you deploy something new. Open source any useful frameworks. Walk down the street and yell to a stranger whenever you ship. Be open, we work on cool stuff.

To which I say: What better time to start than now? Blog I will! I look forward to seeing where this will go.
